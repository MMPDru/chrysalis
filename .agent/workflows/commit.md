# Commit Workflow

After completing any significant work, always commit and push:

// turbo-all

1. Stage all changes:
```bash
git add -A
```

2. Commit with descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

3. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always commit before ending a session or before making experimental changes.
